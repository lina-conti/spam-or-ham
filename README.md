# spam-or-ham

This is a university lab work for my Machine Learning 1 course.

The goal was to train and evaluate a classifier implementing a Naive Bayes classifier to predict whether an email is a spam or a ham. The corpus we worked with came from the ling-spam
dataset that contains spam and non-spam messages from the Linguist list. I did not add it to this github repository.

Instructions for this lab can be found [here](https://github.com/lina-conti/spam-or-ham/blob/main/instructions_naive_bayes.pdf) and my final report [here](https://github.com/lina-conti/spam-or-ham/blob/main/report_naive_bayes.pdf).

I submitted this work in October 2021.
